<h6>Tragedy Romeo juliet SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell</h6>

  <p class="hover">  Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO.<br></p>
'<h6>FRIAR LAURENCE<br></h6>
<p>So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!</p><br>
<h6>ROMEO<br></h6>'
<p>Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.</p><br>
<h6>FRIAR LAURENCE<br></h6>
<p>These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite:
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</p><br>
<p class="hover">Enter JULIET<br></p>

Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.<br>
<h6>JULIET<br></h6>
<p>Good even to my ghostly confessor.</p><br>
<h6>FRIAR LAURENCE<br></h6>
<p>Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.</p><br>
<h6>JULIET<br></h6>
<p>As much to him, else is his thanks too much.</p><br>
<h6>ROMEO<br></h6>
<p>Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.</p><br>
<h6>JULIET<br></h6>
<p>Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.</p><br>
<h6>FRIAR LAURENCE<br></h6>
<p>Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.</p><br>
