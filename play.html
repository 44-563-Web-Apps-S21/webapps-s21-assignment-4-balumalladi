    SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
    SAMPSON
    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
    GREGORY
    No, for then we should be colliers.
    SAMPSON
    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
    GREGORY
    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
    SAMPSON
    I strike quickly, being moved.
    GREGORY
    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
    SAMPSON
    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
    GREGORY
    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
    SAMPSON
    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
    GREGORY
    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
    to the wall.
    SAMPSON
    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
    to the wall.
    GREGORY
    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
    SAMPSON
    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
    maids, and cut off their heads.
    GREGORY
    The heads of the maids?
    SAMPSON
    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
    take it in what sense thou wilt.
    GREGORY
    They must take it in sense that feel it.
    SAMPSON
    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
