    <h6>FRIAR LAURENCE<br></h6>
    <p>So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
    That after hours with sorrow chide us not!</p><br>
    <h6>ROMEO<br></h6>
    <p>Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short minute gives me in her sight:
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
    It is enough I may but call her mine.</p><br>
    <h6>FRIAR LAURENCE<br></h6>
    <p>These violent delights have violent ends
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    And in the taste confounds the appetite:
    Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</p><br>
